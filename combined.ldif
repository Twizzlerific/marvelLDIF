description: The 3-D Man was a 1950's hero who came about through the unique merger of two brothers, Hal and Chuck Chandler. Chuck was a test pilot who was abducted by alien Skrulls during an important test flight. Earth was seen as a strategic location in the ongoing conflict between the alien Kree and Skrull Empires, so the Skrulls were seeking information on Earth's space program and had captured Chuck to interrogate him. Chuck resisted and escaped, accidentally causing the explosion of the Skrull spacecraft in the process. While his brother Hal watched, the radiation from the explosion seemingly disintegrated Chuck, who disappeared in a burst of light. Hal later discovered, however, that the light burst had imprinted an image of Chuck on each lens of Hal's eyeglasses. Through concentration, Hal could merge the images and cause Chuck to reappear as a three-dimensional man. Chuck become the costumed adventurer known as the 3-D Man and single-handedly subverted the Skrulls' early attempts to under

Loki, the Asgardian god of mischief, knew Creel would be the perfect unwitting agent to battle Thor|Thor, so he slipped an enchanted potion into Creel's drinking water in the prison commissary.

In fact, Thor was told that his love, Foster-Kincaid, Jane|Jane Foster, had been kidnapped by Loki, and he left to rescue her. A braggart and lout to the end, Creel flaunted his "success" until Thor returned after making sure Jane Foster was safe. A violent battle ensued, but Thor managed to use his

Inside, Trey found a mystical breastplate he recognized as the Aegis, the legendary Medusa-faced shield of the Greek Glossary:G#god|goddess Athena. Using the breastplate, Rollins became a masked crime-fighter as Aegis, winning the admiration of locals, including young graffiti artists Lester and Payton. After helping the New Warriors defeat the Glossary:A#alien|alien menace Blastaar, Aegis was awarded Warriors membership.

Air-Walker took Galactus to countless worlds, and the two became close. Gabriel actually loved Galactus as a father, and Galactus was also very fond of his herald, telling him endless stories of his travels throughout the cosmos. When the Ovoids, an alien race determined to rid the universe of Galactus' threat, attacked, Air-Walker sacrificed himself to defend his master. Attempting to save his herald, Galactus transferred Gabriel's life force into a highly advanced robotic shell, but the android had no memory of his previous life and was lacking something his Xandarian counterpart had. Galactus had Air-Walker travel to Earth to draw out his previous herald, the Silver Surfer, so Galactus could take him as his herald once more.

description: Untold millennia ago, the Tyannans, a technologically-advanced semi-humanoid/leonine species of the anti-matter universe the Negative Zone, seeded barren worlds with life spores. A freak meteor collision hurled one of their ships into the volcanic planet Arthros, where the crew released their spores before starving to death. Many generations later, one of those spores evolved into a weak insectoid creature. Significantly intelligent due to a mutation, the creature found the Tyannan starship wreckage and used a knowledge transference helmet to master the advanced Tyannan technology. This enhanced his intelligence and strength, creating a "Cosmic Control Rod" and body armaments. Obsessed with survival, the paranoid creature, who came to be known as Annihilus, set out to destroy any other living being he viewed as a possible threat to his existence. Annihilus used his newly acquired power to dominate other lifeforms that had arisen from the spores on Arthros, and plotted to either conquer

Unaware of her true mutant nature, the deeply religious Beaubier believed that her flying was a divine miracle. The School’s headmistress, Soeur Anne, considered it blasphemy and had Beaubier severely disciplined. The resulting corporal punishment triggered a dissociative identity disorder in Beaubier, and a second, extroverted persona emerged. Beaubier secretly left the school that night, returning three days later with no memory of where she had been or what she had done. Subsequent discipline forced Beaubier to repress her second personality, and eventually she became a teacher at the schoo

In the course of pursuing one such event, a farm festival, he was present at a diner when the criminal called Kruel burst upon the scene, fleeing from his employer, Kingpin Wilson Fisk. Fisk beat Kruel and left him for dead, then had Urich and other witnesses drugged to forget the encounter. Perhaps subconsciously influenced by this incident, Urich's efforts to break into crime investigation soon proved successful, and he covered both petty and organized crime in New York, occasionally working with photographer Peter Parker, secretly the super hero Spider-Man.

The squadron including Lincoln, Willie|Willie Lincoln, Cooper, Josh|Josh Cooper, Fong, Chin|Chin Fong, Bruin, Samuel|Samuel Bruin and Red Wolf|William Talltrees, killed most of the villagers, including Tranh's parents. Lincoln was blinded in the assault by a grenade and Janes called helicopter pilot War Machine|James Rhodes to lift them out. As the helicopter began to liftoff, Tranh grabbed the vehicle's landing strut. Even when a wild shot from the jungle struck Tranh in the leg, he clung to the helicopter, until he was kicked by Janes and fell to the Earth. From then on Tranh planned vengeance against his family's killers. He grew to become an accomplished martial artist, donning a Bengal tiger hide costume and wielding twin sais.

While still in high school, she dated university student Gordon Savinski, a fast-living friend of her older brother. Gordon and the Brant siblings were a chummy trio for some time, but Savinski's wild and reckless ways gradually estranged Betty and endangered Bennett. When Gordon and Bennett incurred a huge gambling debt to mobster Blackie Gaxton, Savinski callously abandoned Bennett, leaving the Brants to face the consequences. Gaxton's thugs came to the Brant home, and Betty's mother, Eleonore, suffered permanent brain damage in the resultant scuffle.

description: Within a pocket realm in the Negative Zone, the omnipotent, enigmatic Beyonders created discrete packets of reality-altering energy that could be accessed by others and contained within force fields as Cosmic Cubes. One created by Skrulls eventually evolved into the sentient Shaper of Worlds; one created by A.I.M. was manipulated by a number of forces on Earth before it evolved into Kubik. When Owen Reece accessed one of these energy packets via an electromagnetic accident, part of the energy mutated him into the powerful Molecule Man. The remaining energy gradually gained intelligence and became the Beyonder, who studied life by transporting a number of superhumans to his creation Battleworld and later by traveling to Earth and interacting directly with its residents. The Beyonder remained unfulfilled and eventually faked his death, creating a new realm over which he acted as a god. Eventually, however, the Shaper and Kubik revealed the truth to the Beyonder about his incompleteness,

Fearing that he might be caught, he hired the youthful criminal Rocket Racer to steal the evidence that incriminated him. Rocket Racer did so, but then opted to use the evidence to blackmail Weele. Despairing, Weele tried to commit suicide, but Rocket Racer prevented him from doing so. However, Racer was not particularly kind to Weele, disparagingly referring to him as "Big Weele". Humiliated by Rocket Racer's taunts, Weele visited the mechanical genius and underworld supplier the Tinkerer. Rocket Racer had boasted that the Tinkerer had upgraded his equipment, so Weele figured that he would be a good choice to give him the tools to combat Rocket Racer. At Weele's urging, the Tinkerer created a large metal single-wheeled vehicle that can climb up buildings, equipping it with guns and waldo-arms. With this new vehicle, the Weele became the supervillain "Big Wheel."

Caliban was named by Callisto after the grotesque being in William Shakespeare’s play “The Tempest.” Living in the sewers and abandoned subway tunnels beneath Manhattan’s streets, the naïve Caliban found a renewed sense of family, but still felt lonely even among his fellow outcasts. One evening, Caliban sensed the presence of mutants in a New York City nightclub and entered to find the Dazzler performing. His presence created panic which X-Men members Storm and Shadowcat|Kitty Pryde attempted to quell alongside Spider-Woman, but during the chaos Caliban kidnapped Pryde and fled. Intercepted by the heroes, Caliban explained that he only wanted a friend like himself. Invited to join the X-Men, Caliban chose instead to return to the Morlocks. Image:CalibanMo

description: Carnage was once a serial killer known as Cletus Kasady, and became Carnage after merging with the offspring of the alien symbiote called Brock, Eddie|Venom during a prison breakout. The symbiote amplified his psychotic nature making him even less mentally stable than he had been previously, and therefore even more dangerous. An interesting note is that, unlike Venom, Carnage is a singular entity, referring to himself as "I" instead of "We", because the symbiote has actually merged into Kasady's bloodstream. Carnage is also the "father" of Toxin. A note on his childhood: Cletus' father killed his wife because she tried to kill Cletus. Cletus then testified in court against him, saying that he killed her for no reason, causing him to die by electric chair as means of punishment.image:Carnage inline.jpg|left It is also unclear on Cletus' relationship with his mother, as he seems to have feelings for her, causing him to dig up her grave at the end of Maximum Carnage|his massacre through N

Sensing its monstrous thoughts, Charles attempted to kill the creature resulting in its physical body being stillborn; however, the mummudrai survived as chaotic cellular matter and clung to a sewer wall for decades, rebuilding its physical form and perfecting its effort to mimic human traits.

Mikhail was later discovered to be a latent Glossary:M#mutant|mutant with energy warping powers, and to keep him secret the government faked his death. In later years, Piotr learned that he too was a mutant, and could transform his flesh into steel, but he was content to use his powers to help his fellow farmers. When a transformed Piotr rescued his sister Magik|Illyana from a runaway tractor, he was approached by Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier, who was recruiting mutants for a new team of X-Men to help save his original students from the Glossary:S#sentient|sentient island Krakoa. Dubbed Colossus by Xavier, Piotr reluctantly joined this new team, which freed the original X-Men and helped defeat Krakoa. After the battle, Piotr remained with the X-Men in America, though he found it difficult to adjust to living in a different culture.

description: As a child, Basil Sandhurst grew up plagued with sickness and often lay bed-ridden for months. He grew up to become a scientist as a result of this childhood-- one where he often felt life was never under his control. However, his unorthodox practices and theories, all about harnessing the power of the human mind, only served to bar him from working with any legitimate research center. Instead, his brother Vincent managed to use his influence as a lawyer for Cord Industries to get Basil a job there. Vincent, himself less than scrupulous, hoped Basil would help him take over the company, but when Basil went on a rampage in the lab, Vincent accidentally pushed him into some experimental chemicals. The resultant explosion scarred and crippled Basil, leaving him once more bed-ridden and weak.

The Shi'ar pursued Summers' craft to prevent Summers from making their presence on Earth known to the general public. The Shi'ar craft fired on Summers' plane, which was made of wood, causing it to burst into flame. Unable to find more than one useable parachute in time, Katherine Anne put it on her eldest son Scott, told him to hold onto Alex, and pushed them both out the plane door, hoping to save them both. Scott and Alex thus escaped the Shi'ar.

With his vast wealth, high-tech resources and natural gift for criminal strategy, Nefaria soon became the leader of his own thriving crime family within the Maggia organization, all the while concealing his criminal connections from the general public.

The two teenagers escaped, but not before they were injected with Marshall"s drug, which awakened latent mutant abilities in both of them. Tyrone found himself compelled to drain the life-force of others by enveloping them in the darkness of his cloak. Tandy, on the other hand, gained the ability to project light in the form of energy daggers, which she used

description: Though demons are notorious liars, more reliable sources trace the genesis of the Class Two Demons to the primeval concentration of evil energy left behind when Demogorge drove the evil Elder Gods from Earth billions of years ago. That energy eventually gave rise to demons, shaped by the unconscious desires of their earliest human worshippers. These included at least Mephisto, Satannish, and Thog, though many others followed, each ruling their own nether realms. Other Hell-Lords arose from fallen gods and angels, such as Lucifer|Lucifer, cast down from Heaven. Satan|Marduk Kurios was worshipped by the ancient Sumerians thousands of years ago. It is unclear whether some Mesopotamian Gods may have usurped names and worshippers of demonic predecessors, whether some Gods degenerated into demons or assumed alternate roles such as false angels after being deprived of worshippers in later millennia, and/or if gods may have split off demonic counterparts, or vice-versa. Regardless, the above m

His mother resented Armando for his father's selfishness and Armando resolved to make her happy again. Four years later, testing revealed his genius-level intelligence and private academies offered to fund continuing education; which of course pleased his mother, albeit not for reasons Arando would hope for. His mother gladly enrolled him in the Biltmore Academy boarding school, where he was bullied relentlessly for years due to his appearance until, at age 15, his latent mutant ability manifested and he fought back, subconsciously hardening his hands and beating the bullies unconscious. Later, during a visit home, he saved his mother's life after her smoking caused a fire. The senior scientist at Biltmore tested Armando and published a paper about his ability that 'outed' him as a mutant and dubbed him "Darwin, the Evolving Boy."

Years later, Diablo set up a base in Transylvania, but the villagers there turned against him and buried him within a stone crypt under his castle. Another century later, the Fantastic Four appeared in Transylvania on a vacation. A local, Baron Hugo, told them the legend of Diablo. That night, Diablo whispered to the Thing|Thing to awake and free him from his prison by pulling out the stone plug on his crypt and smashing the stone slab that covered him. Freed, Diablo offered a potion to the Thing that would turn him halfway into a human, and in exchange for Ben’s services for a year, he would give him the other potion that would finalize the change.

She had fought side by side with her teammates against such foes as Deadpool, the Thunderbolts, and Graviton, but it was only during the battle against Maelstrom that her concern for her injured lover led her to be distracted long enough for Maelstrom to deliver a killing blow.

It was hinted that he was a low-level telepathic mutant whose powers emerged at puberty; this mutation may have been responsible for giving his father an aneurysm as his father went to beat him. His father's death in an industrial accident pushed Otto further towards the study of, and obsession with, physical science.

Subsequently enrolled as a student at the Xavier Institute For Higher Learning|Xavier Institute, Sooraya was originally placed in the Special Class to allow her time to acclimatize to her new environment. When the Class' instructor, Xorn, was manipulated into believing he was Magneto|Magneto, Sooraya joined the X-Men in opposing him. Later, when the student body was organized into squads, Sooraya was placed with the rebellious Hellions. Seemingly out of place with her respect for tradition and strong moral code, Sooraya still did her best to work with her teammates. When the Hellions made a deal with the Kingmaker, Sooraya was reunited with her mother. In repayment, the Kingmaker instructed the Hellions to commit crimes for him but they ultimately refused, and Sooraya's mother was lost to her once more.

Josh sent a letter home which only caused his parents to make their disowning of him formal, handing his legal guardianship to the school. Initially, Josh became friends with the group who would later become the Hellions squad, particularly Hellion, but after finding out about Josh's history with the Reavers, they rejected him too, and the New Mutants intervened to save him. After this, he started hanging around with them.

Each couple had one child after the Pride's creation, all six of whom were designated to take their parents' places in the Gibborim's new paradise. While Gertrude was a sophomore in high school, she and the other Pride children learned of their parents' secret lives. Exploring the Yorkes' home, Gertrude discovered a gift for her from her parents: a genetically-created female Deinonychus-like dinosaur from the 87th century. She dubbed the creature Old Lace and took on the code name Arsenic for herself, preferring it to her given name. The two joined the other children in trying to expose the Pride's crimes.

description: The story of the Ghost Rider began over twenty thousand years ago, when the immortals known as the Blood allied themselves with the original Spirits of Vengeance in a war against a soul-stealing demon named Zarathos. To win this war, the Blood created the mystical Medallion of Power, which housed the assembled power of the Spirits of Vengeance. A portion of Zarathos became trapped in this Medallion, too, leading the Blood to decide that the artifact was too powerful to be kept intact. The Medallion was broken into shards and placed into the spiritual bloodlines of two families, both of which would be overseen and protected by a Blood named Caretaker|Caretaker.

His penchant for human souls led him into conflicts with foes such as the Blood cult and the vile Mephisto, who saw Zarathos as a rival. Mephisto ultimately tricked and enslaved Zarathos, rendering the demon amnesiac and trapping him in various mortal forms over many years. This torture eventually dovetailed with another pastime of Mephisto's - the search for the Medallion of Power, a mystical artifact crafted by the Blood that housed the essence of the original Spirits of Vengeance. The medallion had been broken into shards and embedded into the spiritual bloodline of two families. One of these bloodlines, the Kales, attracted Mephisto's attention in the 18th century when Ghost Rider|Noble Kale's shard of the Medallion transformed him into a Spirit of Vengeance, the Ghost Rider. Mephisto failed to corrupt Noble at this time, but he kept track of the Kale clan from then on, watching as Noble manifested in

Finally leaving his wife and kids to seek out the Gorilla Man, Hale ultimately couldn't kill the creature, as it was too much like a human. However, in losing his way back, he was forced to kill the monster when it came for him. As one Gorilla Man died, another was reborn-- Hale was transformed by a strange curse into a new Gorilla Man.

description: Supposedly born bad, Eric Williams always defined himself by comparison to his "good" brother, Wonder Man|Simon. Both brothers struggled in vain for the approval of their demanding, abusive father, Sanford; but where Simon was shy and studious, Eric was athletic, wild and reckless. Regarded as the black sheep of the family, Eric became a thief and tried unsuccessfully to pressure Simon into participating in his petty crimes. Secretly admiring Simon's virtue, Eric developed an unrealistically idealized view of his brother, whom he loved and resented in equal measure. Scorning his family's high-tech manufacturing business, Eric became a gambler and a professional criminal, rising within the ranks of the Maggia organized crime cartel. Simon, meanwhile, dutifully entered the family business and took over its management after Sanford's death. Williams Innovations gradually failed, thanks in part to stiff competition from rival firm Stark Industries, and a desperate Simon turned to Eric for

Disfigured and delirious, he was discovered by disgraced surgeon Jonas Harrow, who, motivated by both humanitarian and experimental interests, replaced the gunman's skull and broken bones with a strong steel alloy, leaving his head broad and flattened. Upon his recovery, the gunman remembered nothing save his criminal ambitions, his mind still fixated upon the mobster poster. Rebuilding his own personality, he became a 1920s-style gangster called Hammerhead. His treatment was the earliest known instance of the criminal empowerment for which Harrow later became infamous. Determined to ascend to the underworld's peak, Hammerhead was willing to work his way to the top, and he moved from one crime family to another as his fortunes waxed and waned. His ambition and viciousness soon earned him a deadly reputat

While working, Hogan soon fell in love with Stark's secretary Potts, Pepper|Virginia "Pepper" Potts and romantically pursued her.

Dorothy Walker’s greatest success was the creation of a comic book named after her young daughter, featuring romantic adventures of Patsy and her real-life friends as teenagers. The Patsy Walker comic book was very popular and continued for over a decade as Patsy grew into and out of her teens. Patsy Walker felt very strange about her mother’s fictionalized exploitation of her, and was relieved when the series ceased publication. Constantly exposed to comic books, Walker grew up to idolize the heroes her mother’s colleagues wrote about. However, she ceased daydreaming soon after high school and married her childhood friend, Mad-Dog|Robert Baxter Baxter was in the officers training program of the Air Force, and Walker spent the next several years of her life on a number of Air Force bases.

The Shi'ar quarantined the Mephitisoids on their homeworld under martial law, fostering a bitter hatred of the Shi'ar and leading to numerous revolts.

Recognizing the need for a son who would be powerful enough to defend both the Olympian gods and humanity from future dangers he foresaw, Zeus seduced Alcmena in the guise of her husband, King Amphitryon of Troezen. Thanks to Zeus's enchantment, Hercules was born with the potential for extraordinary strength, which he first displayed before he was even one year old by strangling two serpents which attacked him. As an adult, Hercules is best known for his celebrated Twelve Labors, which were performed in part to prove his worthiness for immortality to Zeus.

The elder Stane thus killed himself with his first shot, traumatizing young Obadiah. Later, Obadiah decided that his father had realized that the world was his opponent against which he could not succeed, and had therefore intentionally committed suicide.

description: Jack and his brother Drake were active members of Stars and Stripes, the citizen’s action portion of Captain America|Captain America’s Hotline. After Drake became disabled, Jack underwent a physical training regimen, learning several martial arts. When the Serpent Society cheaply bought out the residents of the Sandhaven Acres retirement community after a fraudulent toxic land scare, Jack began investigating. Armed with a “combat boom box” designed by Drake, nineteen year old Jack fashioned a flag-themed costume and intervened when Rock Python and Fer-de-Lance robbed a small bank. Jack, hoping to infiltrate the Society, told King Cobra he wanted to join the group. Cobra, distrusting Jack, sent him to steal from the Reno headquarters of his sometime partner, Mister Hyde|Mr. Hyde, but also warned Hyde about Jack. Hyde severely beat Flag, who was drenched in Hyde’s chemicals during the fight and developed superhuman strength. Briefly felling Hyde with a desperate blow, Flag contacte

description: Miles Warren was born into a family with a proclivity for science. His brother became a science teacher at Midtown High School where Spider-Man|Peter Parker was his favorite pupil, but Miles' talents far exceeded that. After earning his Ph.D in biochemistry, Miles traveled to Wundagore|Wundagore Mountain to assist the High Evolutionary in his experiments to evolve animals into human form. Whereas the Evolutionary's subjects never fully lost their animal appearance, Miles succeeded in creating two "New Men" who looked practically human. This caused some friction between Miles and the Evolutionary that accelerated when a group of New Men began to worship Miles. When Miles evolved a jackal that exhibited a Jekyll-Hyde personality and then escaped, the Evolutionary banished him from Wundagore. Miles stayed in the area where he met and married Monica, fathering two children, but he spent so much time with his research that Monica took the children and left. Unbeknownst to the Warrens, Miles

description: Not much is known about Jane's history prior to meeting Thor. She was a nurse for Dr. Don Blake and over time developed feelings for him. She was torn between "the lame Doctor" and the heroic Thor. Unknown to her at the time, Blake and Thor were the same person. This situation continued until Thor could bear it no more. Defying Odin's orders, he broke down and revealed his secret identity to Ms. Foster and proceeded to transport her to Asgard. There, Jane was briefly granted immortality and the power of the Gods. She was unable to cope with her new powers and asked to be put back on Earth as she once was. Odin, upset at her unworthiness to be a goddess, agreed and whisked her back to Midgard. Back on Earth, with amnesia forced onto her by Odin, she met her husband Dr. Keith Kincaid and had a son with him. Years passed and one day Jane became extremely ill on the verge of death. Sif came to her rescue by infusing her own life force with Jane's as she lay on her deathbed. By

Jocasta acquired the Wasp's personality, emotions, conscience, and ability to control insects, but not her memory. Realizing that the Wasp must die for her to live, Jocasta used that cybernetic insect control to summon the Avengers, who stopped Ultron and reversed the transference, saving Jan but shutting down Jocasta. Unknown to the Avengers, Jocasta still retained some portion of the Wasp's essence, but she remained inert until activated from afar by Ultron. Battling free of the Avengers, Jocasta returned to Ultron's side but quickly realized he was irrevocably evil and aided the Avengers against him. After Ultron's defeat, Jocasta and several Avengers were kidnapped by the Collector; the remaining Avengers soon freed Jocasta and the others, learning of the oncoming universal threat of Korvac in the process.

Kane was able to locate Werewolf By Night|Jack Russell and tracked both him and his sister Lissa Russell. Kane took Lissa as hostage in order to get Jack to cooperate. At the time the moon was going down and during his transformation from a werewolf back to human form, it had left Jack unconscious. Kane was easily able to take the two of them captive at this point. As Jack awoke, Kane told him of how he had lost the thrill of a hunt and in order to get it back, he would be hunting Jack in his werewolf form. If Jack didn’t cooperate, then his sister would die. Jack reluctantly agreed to Kane’s terms. Kane then took Jack to an old movie lot and released him. Kane gave

Azur died in a mysterious undersea mishap. Mander is still a teacher at the seminary.

In order to obtain the needed amount, Klaw hired a group of mercenaries and traveled to Africa in search of it. He found the Wakandan tribe and their leader, T’Chaka, guarding the vibranium, which was part of their sacred mound. Klaw demanded that they give up the mound, but they refused and he ordered his men to kill T’Chaka. They gunned the chief down in front of his young son, Black Panther|T’Challa, who had never before witnessed gunfire. Klaw then used his superior weaponry to massacre the tribesmen and burn down their village. In response, T’Challa stole Klaw’s sound-blaster from one of Klaw’s men and turned it on him, shattering his hand.

This action would insight the conflict that has come to be known as the "War of Three Galaxies." The template was beamed to Earth but instead of hitting stones or metal as hoped, it hit and transformed cockroaches. In this form the Pursuer defeated the Inhumans Royal family; until the Kree defector Falzon used an insecticide to stop the template.

Approximately 5,000 years ago, the Kronans attempted an invasion of Earth. Landing in the city-state of Babylon in a region designated Mesopotamia, the Kronan invasion force was confronted by King Gilgamesh, ruler of the nearby city-state of Uruk. Gilgamesh, with the assistance of a time-traveling warrior from Earth’s future named Captain America, forced the ill-prepared Kronans to retreat to their starship and leave Earth.

When the extraterrestrial Brotherhood of the Badoon conquered Earth and its colony worlds circa 3006-3007, Korvac served the new Badoon regime as a willing collaborator, and was soon placed in charge of analytical computer systems regulating entire planets; however, his new masters worked him to the point of exhaustion. When he collapsed during a duty shift, the Badoon amputated his lower body from the waist down and replaced it with a computerized, hovering special system module, transforming him into a cyborg as punishment and in hopes of making him a more efficient worker. The vengeful Korvac used his new abilities to attack his masters and assimilate data from their computer systems, intending to over

He also used a mystical serum to give him similar strength to Spider-Man, but even without the serum he was a threat to the wall-crawler. However, Kraven's continual underestimation of the superhero's resourcefulness made him a frustrating quarry.

The Kree race began on the planet Hala in the Pama system long before the first mammals appeared on Earth. The original Kree had blue-colored skin. Outwardly humanoid to a large degree, Kree bodies are adapted to environmental characteristics on Hala that are un-Earth-like: notably, higher gravity and higher nitrogen content in the atmosphere. Although the Kree cannot breathe Earth’s atmosphere without special apparatus, their denser bodies afford them about twice the average human being’s strength and endurance. Despite their physical superiority and relatively advanced technology, the Kree race has reached the pinnacle of their evolutionary development.

Kenji felt much shamed by his failure decades earlier, and as a result he ultimately scarred the faces of his three children in a ritual design. Becoming the criminal scientist Lord Dark Wind, Kenji developed a means for bonding the virtually indestructible metal Adamantium to human bone, a procedure he hoped to use in creating an army of super-soldiers for Japan.

For this, Marius magically trapped her in the form of a red-skinned mute dubbed Hollow|Penance. Believing their brother had killed Monet, her young twin sisters banished Marius to another dimension. Seeing Marius as the only way to return to normal, Monet followed. To spare their father from a broken heart at the loss of his favored daughter, the twins used their powers to merge with each other into a single being that duplicated Monet mentally and physically. As Monet, the twins were among those mutants captured by the techno-organic alien Phalanx race, who sought to assimilate mutants into their collective. The twins and their fellow prisoners were rescued by an ad-hoc X-Men team led by Banshee, and they went on to join Generation X, a team of trainee mutants at the Mass

description: Average technician George Tarleton found his fate forever changed thanks to a random selection by his boss, the Scientist Supreme of A.I.M., who needed a unique, bio-engineered “living computer” in order to plumb the mysteries of the Cosmic Cube. Tarleton was subjected to hideous experiments, mutating his body into a massive-headed being possessing superhuman intelligence and extraordinary psionic powers, and the process drove him mad. Given the code-name MODOC, Tarleton instead turned on his superiors, slaying them all and declaring himself Scientist Supreme. Moreover, he changed his name to MODOK, with the “K” standing now for “Killing.”

description: The robot X-51 was created from a top-secret U.S. military project that hoped to make a robot soldier that could think like a man. 51 experimental robots were engineered, but Dr. Abel Stack, computer heuristics programming specialist, knew that the robot could only think like a man if he was treated as one. He stole the 51st robot and began treating him as if he were his own son, calling him Machine Man and even creating an artificial face for him from simulated flesh and hair. Dr. Stack was proven correct: the other 50 robots began experiencing severe personality defects and were deemed too dangerous; the government ordered that the robots’ self-destruct mechanisms be activated. Unfortunately, in the process of removing Machine Man’s self-destruct, Dr. Stack himself was killed when it went off.

He was virtually unknown until the day he gathered together the crime bosses all around the country and announced that he would take over New York and establish it as a sovereign nation with himself as the ruler. Though the one obstacle to the plan was the Fantastic Four, and so the Thinker designed a plan in which he would cause each of the members of the four to be offered ideal jobs, which would distract them away from the Baxter Building. This ploy worked and the Thinker and his allies took advantage of an expected meteor strike which shut off power to New York City, allowing them to break into the Baxter Building. This gave the Thinker access to all of Mister Fantastic|Reed Richard’s knowledge and experiments. Using Richards' research into DNA, he created his first version of the Awesome Andy|Awes

description: The enigmatic Mantis traces her roots back to the family of Vietnamese crimelord Monsieur Khruul who, disapproving of his sister Lua's marriage to German mercenary Gustav Brandt, hunted the couple across Indochina. The Brandts eluded him while Lua bore a child, but Khruul ultimately had their house burned to the ground, killing Lua and blinding Gustav, who fled with their infant daughter. They found sanctuary in the temple of the Priests of Pama, renegade pacifist members of the Glossary:A#alien|alien Kree race who were caretakers of the Cotati, a telepathic race of sentient plants. The Priests trained Gustav, granting him psychic sight, but separated him from his daughter, not wanting his violent nature to influence her development. Brandt eventually left the Temple, later joining the crime cartel Zodiac|Zodiac as Libra.

His father feared what Earth was becoming as Adolf Hitler began to rise to power, and he looked to the stars for comfort instead. The Eternals helped him build a spaceship, and he and his son left Earth to make Uranus their new home. The Eternals helped Bob reach the peak of his potential, but he nevertheless longed to return to the planet of his birth. When he was seventeen, his father relented. The Eternals gave him a personal spacecraft called The Silver Bullet, wristbands that could be used as a defensive weapon, and a tunic that would evoke Apollo, the god of light. His father urged him to use his powers as a champion of the Uranian lifestyle of peace and harmony, and Bob became the superhero known as Marvel Boy! Marvel Boy fought crime for many years, enjoying great fame and favor. He even became an agent of the U.S. government, recruited by Woo

Mephisto's realm includes the Arena of Tainted Souls where tainted souls are locked in perpetual combat. Mephisto delights in impersonating the Biblical Satan. Empowered by the souls of the damned, he often strikes deceptive bargains with the living. Mephisto takes particular interest in the souls of extremely powerful or exceptionally pure beings.

Although she has apparently found a close friend and benefactor in Hellions squad leader Julian Keller, a.k.a. Hellion, Kincaid remains an individual insecure of herself, constantly aiming to please others. In a potential rebellion against restrictive measures in the current crisis, <!-- Which current crisis? Be specific. --> this insecurity might prove to be a beneficial weakness. Kincaid does not appear to be aware of the scope of her mutation, nor of its inherent potential, as she continues to consume food and treat her body in the same fashion as she did prior to the manifestation of her abilities.

Despite the enhanced strength of her new arm, Misty's injury removed her from active patrol duty, and she resigned rather than accept a desk job. Depressed over these developments, she was encouraged by Colleen to again take an active role in life, and the two eventually became partners in a private investigation firm, Nightwing Restorations.

description: Marc Spector was the son of a rabbi whose family had fled Europe in the 1930s to escape the Holocaust. As Marc matured, he rejected his father's morality and embraced materialism. He became a heavyweight boxer, then a U.S. Marine, and then a CIA operative. At the CIA, Marc worked with William Cross, who betrayed the agency, later becoming the villain Crossfire. Marc's brother, Shadowknight|Randall, joined him in the CIA but he also betrayed the agency, selling weapons to both sides in an altercation in Italy. When Marc's lover Lisa overheard Randall's plans, he killed her with a meat cleaver. Marc hunted Randall down, inflicting injuries that left Randall psychotic. Marc befriended fellow CIA agent Lardner, Amos|Amos Lardner, but unknowingly turned him over to Operation: Cobra, a CIA project designed to control its agents' minds. Fed up with the CIA, Marc became a mercenary and spent several years as a hired gun. Although he ostensibly sought to fight for causes he believed in, Marc wa

The Dragon secretly survived inside her, bolstering and feeding upon the darker aspects of her personality.

description: Nobel Prize-winning biochemist Dr. Michael Morbius discovered he was dying from a rare disorder dissolving his blood cells. Not wanting to distress his fiancée Martine, Morbius began secretly working on a cure. With the aid of his partner Emil Nikos, Morbius attempted using distilled fluids from bats to stay his disease. While experimenting with such serums on board his yacht, Morbius had Nikos run an electrical shock through his system. The combination profoundly changed Michael's body, transforming him into something resembling a vampire. Now driven by a blinding hunger for blood, Morbius slew Nikos, but stopped short of draining his friend's body. Fearful that he would strike at Martine next, Michael tried ending his life by jumping into the sea, but self-preservation led him to escape the water's embrace.

The research was incredibly expensive, so Zabo systematically robbed his various employers, avoiding criminal prosecution by simply changing employers before he could be caught. However, his reputation caught up with him. Zabo applied for work with a noted surgeon, Dr. Donald Blake, the secret identity of Thor|Thor, but was refused employment based on his past misdeeds. Zabo became furious and vowed vengeance upon the lame doctor. When he struck upon the formula several months later, Zabo transformed himself into Mister Hyde.

First he teamed up with the Tinkerer to steal industrial and military plans, with Beck donning an alien costume to throw potential snoopers off the track and leading a group of supposed extraterrestrials. Later, an article in the Daily Bugle gave Beck the idea of pretending to be Spider-Man|Spider-Man and framing him for crimes, then becoming a hero and bringing Spider-Man to justice. Beck studied Spider-Man for weeks and was able to duplicate his powers, apart from spider-sense, mechanically.

To this end, he made use of his cellmate, Daniel Berkhart, taking him into his confidence, teaching him all his secrets and training him to replace him as Mysterio, even as he engineered his own "death". Berkhart was released, looking for revenge on behalf of his "buddy" Beck, and was hired by Jameson, J. Jonah|Jameson to pretend to be the ghost of Mysterio and capture Spider-Man|Spider-Man. He plagued Spider-Man with illusions, even as Peter Parker, by planting an image-inducer on the wall-crawler's costume. Spidey later used the inducer to track down and confront a nervous Berkhart. When Spider-Man wasn't fooled by the ghost routine, Berkhart lost his temper and was easily overcome. Jameson abandoned him when he was jailed and he resented Jameson ever since.

description: Nearly two decades ago, a group of petty thieves, minor league scientists, bumbling time travelers, soap stars, and other unsavory characters were contacted by the gigantic Gibborim, who offered them a shot at immortality in exchange for betraying the human race. Newlyweds Tina and Robert Minoru brought magical expertise to this group, which began calling itself the Pride. Several years after the Pride's formation, its couples decided to have children. Tina and Robert produced a daughter, Nico, who spent much of her life in the dark about her parents' dark dealings. Eventually, Nico and the other Pride offspring discovered their parents' secret sacrificial ritual and ran away from home. After a confrontation with her parents, Nico discovered she could control the mystical Staff of One formerly wielded by her mother. When the Runaways decided to adopt new names, Nico chose Sister Grimm, her AOL Instant Messenger screen name.

description: When Charles Xavier telepathically rendered Magneto catatonic, he unknowingly absorbed Magneto’s dark ego. Magneto’s negative emotions merged with Xavier’s suppressed urges, forming a powerful, dormant psionic entity - the self-dubbed Onslaught. Rising anti-mutant hysteria, Legacy Virus casualties and Xavier’s failure to rehabilitate Sabretooth all increased Xavier’s frustration. When anti-mutant humans killed young mutant Hogan, Dennis|Dennis Hogan near the Xavier Institute, Onslaught finally awakened within Xavier, and it decided to achieve Xavier’s dream of peaceful mutant/human coexistence by utilizing the interdimensional firm Landau, Luckman & Lake’s warp portals to bond humanity into a collective intelligence. To this end, Onslaught attempted to generate fear to heighten psionic activity. In Vancouver, B.C., Onslaught sought to recruit Xavier’s step-brother Juggernaut|Cain Marko, the criminal Juggernaut. When Marko declined, Onslaught mentally blocked Juggernaut from remembering

For decades, Ord fought and won in many arena-style battles for the honor of being chosen to travel to Earth with a declaration of war. However, the spy agency S.W.O.R.D., a sub-division of S.H.I.E.L.D. that handles extraterrestrial matters, was able to settle diplomatically with him by offering him a chance to eradicate the mutant gene, while they would seek to identify the mutant that would be responsible for the Breakworld’s destruction.

description: Praxagora’s home world of Ataraxia existed within the Negative Zone|Negative Zone’s Helicon Cluster. It was a place of perfect architecture and beauty. She is from a race of Ataraxian|complex living machines; they aspired to exist in complete harmony with every living creature. They have also mastered stellar containment technology; this enabled them to power themselves and their society. Sadly, it was their peaceful ways that left them defenseless, against the Annihilation|Annihilation Wave. Annihilus deemed the Ataraxians as an extreme threat to his reign. He invaded their world and slaughtered all the inhabitants.

description: Preak was a ten year old member of the Panspermian race, a species genetically engineered from a silicone based life form by the Pralagon Shapers of the Barador Nebula. They were used primarily as beast of burden in the Pralagon system. Panspermians were designed to be extremely adaptable and devoid of such reproductive issues as sex, pregnancy or gestation. They were to survive under any condition and provide inexpensive, easily multiplied labor and base level combat force. All Panspermians were essentially identical and may even share the same memories with the original body from which it was replicated. The species was engineered with minimum intellect and maximum subservience, taking pleasure from even the most trivial of social interactions. They are considered a simple species with little use beyond their initial design.

One adventure led him to pursue the fabled Black Blade of Baghdad. Becoming fascinated with the mystic blade, he kept it for himself upon finding it rather than turn it over to his patrons. However, in touching the blade, he released the Earth-bound spirit named Raazer that was contained within it. Apparently it was as much Judd's dishonest thoughts as his touch that released the sorcerer. Raazer had been imprisoned in the blade long ago by his fellow Persian sorcerers to prevent him from killing any more people with the Black Blade, which had originally been a gleaming white scimitar before his evil had corrupted it over the centuries. Raazer began stealing parts of Judd’s life-force, passing his blade through him, and in the process reducing him in height. Before he could die, however, Judd fought back against Raazer, u

description: The Mad Thinker built Quasimodo as an advanced, calculating computer, which he used to aid him in his crimes. But Quasimodo was so advanced that he became sentient and spent years trapped in his computer form, begging his master to give him a human form. The Thinker even allowed his electrons to form a face and gave him his abbreviated name, making him feel more like a living being. But the Thinker refused to give him human form, explaining that he was a computer and made to stay as a computer. When Quasimodo asserted himself, the Thinker used his Discipline Ray to torture him until he obediently followed his orders.

Among his achievements, Quentin created a set of anti-gravity floats to grant mobility to the disembodied brain of his fellow student Martha Johansson. Devastated after learning that he was adopted, Quentin was pushed over the edge following the death of renowned mutant fashion designer Jumbo Carnation, supposedly at the hands of humans. He began to doubt Xavier's teachings, and developed a more negative and hostile view of the world and of humankind.

Elvin eluded them by hiding in the heavily polluted waters of Newtown Creek, but before he could climb out, Fisk Biochem workers dumped more illegal chemical waste into the creek, dousing him with it. Terrified and in pain, Elvin ran home to his only family, Granny Staples, and she nursed him back to health over a period of days. The boy recovered quickly, and in the weeks and months that followed, he went through a tremendous growth spurt that gave him a superhumanly powerful adult body. He was discouraged from seeking vengeance on his tormentors by the devoutly religious Granny Staples, who felt he should use his new powers for good. Fashioning a makeshift costume from a ski mask and a leather outfit, Elvin began operating as the super-vigilante Rage at the age of 14, targeting street criminals and drug dealers such as L.D.

Help came in the form of the Dark Beast, who gave Stone control in exchange for his services as a superhuman operative. Though still only a young boy, Stone used his powers to make himself appear larger and older, becoming the bounty hunter Random. Stone often worked with the government-sponsored X-Factor team until the Dark Beast had him betray them by capturing their leader, Havok. Stone later aided Havok against the Dark Beast, freeing himself from servitude. He briefly joined Magneto|Magneto's mutant army in Genosha before being captured by the Weapon X Program and incarcerated in the "Neverland" concentration camp. There, he was selected to become a field agent but was ultimately freed after a change in Weapon X's leadership.

Ivan crewed his ship with a trio of apes that he had trained to operate the ship, repair its machinery, and fire weapons, which he kept under-fed so that they would continue to obey him. And because Ivan had spent time researching the Fantastic Four, he was prepared for the cosmic rays he would encounter along the way, though unlike the four heroes, Ivan constructed his spaceship out of transparent, ceramic plastic to allow as much of the cosmic rays to filter through as possible. So that once he had reached space, Ivan and his three apes were bombarded by an intense dose of the rays, more than the Fantastic Four before them. Ivan’s Gorilla became super-strong; his orangutan

A massive albino taunted by his peers because of his appearance, the brutal Lonnie considered Robbie a friend of sorts since Robbie was one of the few who never mocked him; however, when Lonnie began using his considerable strength to extort money from classmates, Robbie prepared a story for the Harlem High paper exposing Lonnie's activities. Ambushing Robbie after school, Tombstone beat him bloody until Robbie agreed to kill the story, which never saw print. Lonnie saw this as a cordial understanding between friends, but Robbie was disgusted with himself and determined never to compromise his ethics

One of the few exceptions was a young man named Wolverine|Logan, whom Sabretooth sensed had superhuman abilities similar to his own. Hating the love that existed between Logan and a young Indian girl named Silver Fox, Sabretooth brutally assaulted her, apparently raping her and leaving her for dead. The enraged Logan then forced Sabretooth into a pitched battle, which ended with Sabretooth victorious. Unbeknownst to either combatant, Silver Fox survived the attack and soon departed from the community.

Even as his DNA deteriorated, Kaine grew taller and stronger than the original Spider-Man.

description: The only daughter of a wealthy diamond miner, Shanna grew up in the Zaire jungles. At age six, Shanna witnessed her father’s accidental fatal shooting of her mother, starting a lifelong loathing of firearms. Traumatized, she moved to America to live with relatives, studying to become a veterinarian; after graduation she worked for the New York Central Park Zoo. The death of a leopard she had raised led Shanna to quit, taking its cubs, Ina and Biri, to raise them in the African Dahomey Reserve, which she protected from poachers and others as “Shanna the She-Devil”.

In this timeline, the X-Men were betrayed by one of their own and killed, causing a disaster that caused the government to place a stylized 'M' tattoo over the left eyes of all mutants. After their grandmother died, Shard and Bishop took to the streets until the Xavier Security Enforcers approached them for membership. The X.S.E.'s purpose was to find and train young mutants and to protect the dream of human-mutant harmony created by Professor X|Professor Xavier, much like the X-Men in the present. Bishop and Shard were the two youngest mutants to be promoted to be officers in the X.S.E., and Shard was the youngest commanding officer in the history of the X.S.E.

During an early mission against Hydra, Sharon was attacked by the mercenary Batroc and aided by Captain America. Initially knowing her only as Agent 13, Cap worked alongside Carter on several subsequent missions against A.I.M., the Nazi Red Skull|Red Skull, and others; the two soon became lovers, and Cap was also reunited with Peggy Carter, helping her recover from mental despair. Eventually, Sharon was assigned as liaison to the NYC police while investigating the terrorist organization called the National Force. Supposedly affected by mind-influencing gas, Sharon infiltrated the National Force, and when confronted by the National Guard, was apparently incinerated by the self-destruct device in her uniform, leaving Cap to grieve for her death.

Some sources suggest that Shatterstar possesses superhuman abilities relating to the absorption of sonic and vibrational energy, as well as an intuitive learning capability, but these claims can not be substantiated at this time. Shatterstar is known to have served in the unsanctioned mutant group X-Force, and has been involved in numerous superhuman conflicts.

The Shi’ar originated on a planet they call Aerie and their civilization predates Earth humans’ recorded history. Shi’ar has both avian and mammalian characteristics: for example, although Shi’ar are outwardly humanoid and mammalian in form, they have feathers instead of hair. At an earlier point in their evolution, the Shi’ar had fully developed wings attached to their arms, enabling them to fly. Shi’ar females have mammary glands and are viviparous. Shi’ar are physically stronger than Earth humans: the average Shi’ar can lift about 1 ton. Shi’ar also had twenty times the endurance of an Earth human. Apparently the Aerie’s environmental conditions are similar to those of Earth, since Shi’ar can exist on Earth without artificial aids.

However, it is still unclear as to how her powers actually developed. It could be that she already had these powers but they didn’t manifest themselves until she was exposed to Cloak’s darkness, or they could have been a side effect of the drugs she was taking, or it could have been a combination of these events, among others

Miyami soon bore twins, but faked their deaths and her own so Tai could not exploit them. To replace these children in the pact, Tia mystically forced Chord to kill his friends the Taylors and take custody of their son, Dwayne.

In a third group, they implanted a gene series which would enable rapid benevolent mutation under the right conditions when the species matured. This group, its genetic modifications latent, remained the Skrullian “Normals”. After performing their genetic diversification, the Celestials left. The Deviant branch

Believing the twins were fragments of his own lost soul, Master Pandemonium abducted the twins resulting in the twins seemingly being reabsorbed into a reconstituted Mephisto; however, the twins' souls had been so transfigured by the Scarlet Witch's magic that they temporarily destroyed Mephisto. Believed destroyed, the twins' souls were apparently cast back in time & reborn as individual entities. Thomas ended up in Springfield, new Jersey, while William was adopted by Jeff & Rebecca Kaplan & raised in New York's Upper West Side by Frank & Mary Sheperd.

Saunders agreed, and he created a formula based on information given to him by the Grandmaster and that granted him superhuman speed. The Grandmaster then had him take the identity of the Whizzer, join the Squadron Sinister, and fight the Avengers, who themselves were pawns of the Grandmaster’s opponent, Kang The Conqueror.

When she got there, a fight between the Sisterhood of the Wasps and the Spider Society left her fatally injured. Miguel, the Spider Society's sorcerer, was forced to transfer some of his power to her to save her life, and after the transfer she received a spider-shaped tattoo which gave her enhanced strength and agility. It also presumably gave her an exoskeleton. Araña and Miguel shared several adventures together as the Mage-Hunter team for the Spider Society, preventing the Wasps from summoning their chosen warrior. Recently, Araña learned that she is not a true Hunter. No Hunter before her has ever had an exoskeleton like hers. In a battle in which the Sisterhood again attempted to summon their Hunter, Miguel was killed. Araña released and transferred the power of the Hunter to Spider Society member Nina Smith, yet Anya retaine

The conversation between Thor and his twin counterpart was violently interrupted when Stellaris, the Celestial Slayer, attacked.

When the Institute was attacked by the mutant-organ-harvesting U-Men, the Cuckoos were among the students that helped oppose them. Later, the Cuckoo Esme romanced a student named Kato who revealed himself to be Stuff, a spy for the alien Shi'ar Empire's Imperial Guard who had been dispatched to Earth by Nova, Cassandra|Cassandra Nova to eradicate mutant kind. Along with Emma and fellow student Angel Salvadore, the Cuckoos were captured, but were able to defeat Stuff and free Emma. With her help, the Cuckoos were able to create a trap for Nova.

description: Wilbur Day was a scientist at Kaxton Labs who stole designs for a hydraulic ramming device from his company out of frustration of his position in his job. He soon invented a battlesuit and tried his hand at petty villainy-- looting stores and robbing pedestrians. Later on, he tried suing the company, with Daredevil|Matt Murdock as his attorney, claiming legal ownership of Kaxton's original design and going so far as to accuse Kaxton of being the Stilt-Man. Eventually, Day was discovered to actually be Stilt-Man. Day, wearing the stilts but not the rest of his armored suit, used an experimental molecular condenser gun, based on another idea of Kaxton's, to attempt to eliminate Daredevil. But in battling Daredevil, Day himself was struck by the molecular condenser's ray and shrank seemingly into nothingness.

Unfortunately, it became a target of the Plunderer, and the city was rescued upon the arrival of Namor the Sub-Mariner. This was the first meeting between Newell and Namor, and the two became friends. However, their friendship was soon threatened when Newell was forced by the government to locate Namor, who was believed to be in league with an extraterrestrial threat to Earth. Creating the Stingray costume, Newell succeeded in capturing the Sub-Mariner, although Namor soon escaped and Newell, while initially defeating him a second time, allowed his friend to go.

When Ororo was six months old, she and her parents moved to Cairo, Egypt. Five years later, during the Arab-Israeli conflict, a plane crashed into their home. Ororo's parents were killed, but she survived, buried under rubble near her mother's body. The resultant trauma left Ororo with severe claustrophobia that still affects her today.

Gigantus, the home of a highly advanced and pacifistic people, was the target of the imperialistic race of Eternians, who decided to destroy Gigantus when it proved too big to conquer. Before their world’s destruction, however, a vast fleet of Gigantian escaped to retaliate against their attackers. After destroying Eternus, the Gigantians in some as yet unknown way melded their minds into a single being, apparently to one day combat Eternians’ similar composite entity, the Overmind. It is not yet known what the process of this merger entailed: whether the composite-form’s body is an artificial organic construct or one of the Gigantians’ bodies enhanced to be a suitable receptacle for h

In need of a powerful warrior who would oppose Apocalypse, Mother Askani sent a female member of the cult back to the X-Men's own time period. The Apocalypse of that time infected the infant Nathan Christopher Summers with a techno-organic virus that was rapidly spreading through his body and, if not stopped, would kill him. The Askani cult member persuaded Cyclops to let her take the infant to the far future, where advanced medical science could save his life.

description: Prior to enrolling at the Xavier Institute, Noriko Ashida lived on the street and was reliant on illegally obtained prescription drugs to reduce her highly accelerated mutant brain functions to a manageable rate. Since joining the Institute, Ashida has been equipped with two technological gauntlets to control and regulate her abilities. Having run away from her parents in Japan when her father refused to accept her genetic mutation, Ashida has demonstrated that she is prepared to rebel against authority if she deems it necessary. Nonetheless, Ashida recently helped to oppose a group of Xavier Institute students intent on freeing one of their fellow students, who had been apprehended by F.B.I. agents in the process of an investigation. Due to Ashida's conflicting past behavior, a conclusive prediction of her reaction to restrictive measures against mutants is not possible at this time. She soon became romantically involved with a fellow classmate, Prodigy.

More than any of his people, Thanos sought out personal power and increased strength, endowing himself with cybernetic implants until he became more powerful than any of his brethren. At some point, he was exiled from his community, although the accounts differ as to its cause. Some say it was because he committed a crime by being the first to create a weapon.

Gigantus, the home of a highly advanced and pacifistic people, was the target of the imperialistic race of Eternians, who decided to destroy Gigantus when it proved too big to conquer. Before their world’s destruction, however, a vast fleet of Gigantian escaped to retaliate against their attackers. After destroying Eternus, the Gigantians in some as yet unknown way melded their minds into a single being, apparently to one day combat Eternians’ similar composite entity, the Overmind. It is not yet known what the process of this merger entailed: whether the composite-form’s body is an artificial organic construct or one of the Gigantians’ bodies enhanced to be a suitable receptacle for h

So desperate did Toynbee become for affection that he developed a pathetically subservient personality, and would unquestioningly obey anyone he thought sincerely cared about him.

Longtime exposure to asbestos ruined Raymond’s health and he left Horton’s employ. Soon afterwards Raymond married Nora Jones, a scientist who was herself seriously ill from overexposure to radium in her experiments. They honeymooned in Mexico and nine months later their son Thomas was born. They nicknamed him “Toro” in memory of the bullfights they had seen on their honeymoon. As Thomas grew into boyhood, his parents realized that they would probably die from their illnesses before he became an adult. However, they discovered that Thomas was immune to fire and Nora theorized that he was a mutant.

description: During World War I, Lord Falsworth was recruited by the British army to become one of the first public superhero champions: Union Jack. His superiors decided to create a guise that would strike terror in enemy hearts as well as rally troops-- by having Falsworth appear as a personification of the British national flag. He fought valiantly throughout the war, eventually joining similar national heroes in a group called Freedom's Five. He also fought the vampire Baron Blood|Baron Blood, a German agent, and the infamous Hellfire Club, which he prevented from awakening a harbinger of Apocalypse|Apocalypse, Ch’Vayre. After the war was over, Union Jack was retired, and Falsworth settled back into life at Falsworth Manor and began to raise his family.

In escaping the war-torn country, an unspecified accident scarred the right side of her face, and to compensate, she began wearing her hair so that it hid her disfigurement. She struggled for survival, wandering throughout Europe, finding crime to be her only means of survival. At some point, she entered into a pact with the Elder God Chthon, who was trapped in the mountain of Wundagore. This pact greatly slowed her aging process, allowing her to become a fearsome mercenary and criminal as the years passed.

description: The story of werewolves begins with the ancient Wolf God/Demon, believed to be one of the Elderspawn, the children of the Elder Gods. Millions, possibly billions, of years ago, the Wolf Demon spawned a race of Wolf-Men who warred against other Elderspawn such as the Bird-Women, Harpies, Bat-Men, Flying Fiends, Demons, Goblins, Serpent Men, and Spider-Men. Some of these races enslaved the developing humans, but by 20,000 B.C., most of the Elderspawn had been slaughtered or driven into seclusion, briefly rising to challenge societies such as Valusia and Atlantis. The Wolf-Men could assume human form, and humans scratched or bitten by them became Wolf-Men in turn. They could survive most injuries, but were vulnerable to silver and fire.

description: Mark Scarlotti was a brilliant young man with a bright future. Graduating with top honors from college and a promising job at Stark International, Scarlotti could have had it all. It all went south, however, when he became friends with the wrong people. Filled with dreams of grandeur, he made some bad deals with hopes of a big payoff. Eventually, Mark worked developing weapons, first for the Maggia, then for himself. He took a more active role in their activities and became the costumed criminal known as Whiplash. His first real test put him up against the invincible Iron Man|Iron Man, but Whiplash could not complete the task of eliminating him. Suffering defeat after defeat at the hands of his armored foe, Scarlotti upgraded his weaponry and took a new alias. He remerged on the crime scene with a new attitude and called himself Blacklash. His appearance might have changed, but his track record did not. The defeat, he recalled, as being the most humiliating was when Iron Man brought hi

He also tried his hand at other professions where his powers gave him an edge, and he agreed to help a criminal ring organize fix races he was in until the police got wise to the system and made the criminals uneasy. Always over-confident, Cannon instead flaunted his abilities, creating the costumed identity of the Human Top. His crime spree was stopped by Pym, Henry|Dr. Henry Pym, in his early career as Giant-Man, with his partner Wasp. This was but the first of several defeats, and Cannon only grew deeper in his desire for revenge.

When the Sons disbanded, their discarded amulets were discovered by Angela's uncle, the young White Tiger|Hector Ayala, who transformed into the superhuman White Tiger through their power. In this guise, Ayala fought foes such as the Corporation crime cartel and teamed with heroes such as Daredevil|Daredevil, the Defenders, Human Fly, Jack of Hearts and Prowler|Prowler, though his most frequent ally was Spider-Man|Spider-Man. After the Tiger's secret identity was exposed in a confrontation with the criminal Lightmaster, megalomaniac Gideon Mace decided to make Ayala his first target in a war on super-heroes.

Eventually found by the subversive organization, the Secret Empire, Gibney was experimented upon in their attempts to create a perfect killing machine. As a part of the experiment, Gibney was injected with DNA from the assassin Wyre, which left Gibney near-mindless, animalistic, and uncontrollable. Wyre later rebelled and destroyed the Secret Empire's headquarters, and Gibney was found by agents of the Canadian government and given over to Department H, then headed by Guardian|James Hudson as a sanctioned program for developing Canada's Glossary:S#super hero|superhero teams. Hudson placed Gibney in the entry-level Gamma Flight with the code-name Wild Child. During his training, Wild Child was mentored by Wolverine|Wolverine until he left to join the X-Men.

Stryker went insane, killing mother and child. He then ignited their car in the attempt to commit suicide. The incident and his behavior afterwards soon caused Stryker to be discharged from the military. Stryker learned from articles by Professor X|Charles Xavier that his son was a mutant. He became convinced that Satan had a plot to corrupt humankind by taking over their souls while still in the womb, resulting in their mutations. He began to think of himself as 'chosen by God' to destroy mutants and formed Strkyer's Crusade and the Purifiers. While his followers committed hate crimes against mutants, Stryker had an elaborate campaign to take out the X-Men and Stryker arranged to have Professor Xavier kidnapped, brainwashed, and attached to a machine that, using his brainpower, would kill all living

During an attack by the Dominant Species, a pack of mutant werewolves seeking revenge on the X-Men from a previous encounter, Gleason was forced to wrestle with his lupine nature, at one point attacking and severely injuring the X-Man Havok over a trivial dispute. Ultimately, he rejected the Dominant Species' attempts to recruit him and assisted the X-Men in defeating them. Gleason eventually joined the Xavier Institute's Paragons training squad. While his past violent outbursts may have been due to the influence of the Dominant Species, Gleason is to be considered a potential concern until more precise conclusions about his personality can be drawn.

As part of this birthright, he claimed ruler-ship of the Atlas Foundation, one of the most inscrutable, pervasive and enduring secret societies on Earth and one intent on perpetuating the ancient Mongol Empire.

description: Though magic users on Earth have reanimated the dead using various means for thousands to millions of years, the Voodoo god Sagbata and the Elder God Chthon combined forces in the 17th century to create a potent spell, and most subsequent practitioners have tapped into their magic to create zombies; however, the best known zombie, Simon Garth, is strangely atypical. War hero Simon Garth was senior partner for 25 years to Brian Stockwood in Garwood Industries, maker of leading Garth Manor Coffee. Divorced after assaulting his wife Miranda, Garth raised their daughter, Donna, to adulthood in New Orleans, Louisiana. The controlling Garth violently berated and fired his gardener Gyps for lusting after Donna. Gyps later ambushed Garth, taking him into the bayou where a "red sect" of voodoo practitioners planned a human sacrifice. The priestess of the ritual was Layla, Garth's secretary, who had fallen in love with him. Layla pretended to perform the sacrifice, but then allowed Garth to flee

description: The Brotherhood of Mutants is a group dedicated to the cause of mutant superiority over humans. Throughout its various incarnations, the Brotherhood's agenda has gravitated towards either subjugating the human race to the will of mutants or eradicating humanity altogether. Magneto|Magneto formed the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, including Astra|Astra, Toad, Quicksilver, Scarlet Witch|Scarlet Witch, and Mastermind|Mastermind, shortly after the public debut of the X-Men. After a falling out with Astra that led to her quitting the team, Magneto had the Brotherhood initiate an attack upon humans that was thwarted by the X-Men. Magneto then attempted to recruit the thunder god Thor|Thor into his Brotherhood, but Thor refused. The Blob was the next candidate for recruitment, but ultimately declined to join after seeing the way Magneto mistreated his followers. Mastermind then sought to recruit Unus the Untouchable; however, he was blackmailed by the X-Men into declining the offer in exchange

description: Annihilus persuaded the inhabitants of the Negative Zone that they were on the verge of being erased from existence by the ever expanding positive matter universe, which was crossing into the Negative Zone. They reluctantly joined Annihilus in a quest for survival. He gathered one hundred super powered beings known as the Centurions; they were self-described keepers of the chaotic realms, much like the heroes of Earth, they were a wildly diverse group and possessed among them a verity of innate and artificial physical, mental, and other worldly powers. On Daedalus 5, a system on the periphery of the Kree|Kree Empire, Annihilus finally employed the Centurions led by Hybelea, as a united strike team. Despite opposing forces that included the likes of Nova|Nova, Gamora, Drax the Destroyer, Ronan the Accuser, the Super Skrull and two former Heralds of Galactus, the Centurions assault broke the back of the resisting forces, effectively ending the military phase of the war.

The team began with an attack on the UCLA campus by the rogue Olympians|Olympian Glossary:G#god|god Pluto, who sought to force his fellow gods Hercules and Venus into marrying Hippolyta and Ares as part of a plot to overthrow Olympian monarch Zeus. Hercules and Venus resisted with the aid of super-spy Black Widow, Glossary:D#demon|demon cyclist Ghost Rider, and Glossary:M#mutant|mutant heroes Angel, and Iceman. Pluto's plot was foiled, and while Venus chose to return to Olympus, the other five heroes decided to remain together as a new super-team, the Champions.

Later, when the Yannian scientist Yandroth menaced Earth with the Omegatron doomsday device, Dr. Strange persuaded a reluctant Hulk and Namor to help him thwart Yandroth's scheme, forming the "non-team" known as the Defenders. After Yandroth's defeat, Hulk and Namor vowed never to work together again, but Strange managed to hold their informal alliance together over time. Unlike other super-teams, these Defenders had no charter or by-laws, no permanent headquarters, no fixed roster, and little affection for each other.

The Scarlet Witch's hex powers were expected to interface with PLATO's probability programs, predicting crisis points.

Deathurge became Craig's supposedly imaginary childhood friend, leading the boy into all sorts of potentially lethal activities until his eighth birthday, when Craig's father Edward died in a fire after Craig and "D'urge" had played with matches. Placed in an abusive foster home with the O'Doughan family, Craig befriended and ultimately fell in love with the O'Doughans' daughter, Terri, outgrowing the need for his "imaginary" friend. Craig and Terri eventually ran off together to Milwaukee, but lingering depression from her upbringing led Terri to commit suicide, and Craig was shocked to see a very real "D'urge" escort her spirit away. Despairing, Craig tried repeatedly to kill himself, but soon realized he had the mutant power to recover from fatal injuries.

Hydra agents wear green costumes with cowls concealing the entire head except for the mouth and chin. Their organization takes its name from the many-headed serpent-like monster known for its ability to grow two heads immediately to replace any head that was severed. Hydra prides itself on its ability to regroup and rebuild itself, allegedly mightier than before, after any major defeat. Indeed, the organization has now endured for four decades.

It began with Eric Williams, whose brother Simon betrayed the Avengers as Wonder Man but ultimately sacrificed himself to save them from the Masters of Evil. A grief-maddened Eric blamed the Avengers for Simon’s death and became their mortal enemy as the Grim Reaper, eventually joining forces with fellow Avengers foes Living Laser, Man-Ape, Atlas|Power Man, and Swordsman|Swordsman, as the Lethal Legion, whose members competed with each other to see who could capture or kill the most Avengers. The Legion was soon defeated and imprisoned, thanks largely to the android Vision, a new Avengers recruit whose artificial mind was programmed with a copy of the late Simon’s brain patterns.

description: The Morlocks are a large community of mutants who feel they are outcasts, living in the underground tunnels beneath New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. These tunnels were built in the 1950s by the U.S. Government as shelters in case of a national emergency, and later abandoned. The vast majority of the public has no idea these tunnels exist. There are numerous tunnels stretching out of sight, many unexplored. The main tunnel is 50 feet high and runs the length of Manhattan. It is called "the alley" by its inhabitants.

description: They were adolescents- kids- too young to be X-Men, but old enough to start the training that would allow them to fully understand and harness their profound mutant powers. Professor X brought together Cannonball|Cannonball, Karma, Moonstar, Wolfsbane, and Sunspot to become the first New Mutants team. Over time, Magma, Cypher|Cypher, Warlock|Warlock, and Magik|Magik were added to the team and, as they learned to become more powerful mutants together, they learned another important lesson: It's okay to act like normal kids. The New Mutants enjoyed their status as mutants and their youth. But when duty called, maturity set in, and the New Mutants went into action- though sometimes not without consequence. During an assignment, Cypher was shot and killed after leaping into the path of a bullet destined for his teammate Wolfsbane.

Dwayne fought crime as Night Thrasher, forging a vigilante partnership with the superhuman brother-and-sister duo Midnight's Fire and Silhouette, and romancing the latter; however, their alliance ended badly when Silhouette was shot by a gangster. Blaming Thrasher for the tragedy, Fire disappeared with his fallen sister, swearing vengeance.

He sent a signal to his people requesting permission, but it was intercepted by the warlike Snarks, who sent ships to steal the process. They shot down Whitey's Smartship Friday, though not before he managed to remotely wipe Power's computers, leaving James the only person who knew the process.

The cosmic Consonance deemed that there be order and balance to this chaos. The universe does not measure time, but by natural sequence, a balance was struck and the cosmic consonance was set. From the chaos came order, and from order intent. They became the caretakers, conceived through intent. Each of them had been tasked to maintain the cosmic consonance. They were without will and without awareness of anything but the task set before them. They existed to serve the living Universe. They were the Proemial Gods.

Originally a band of mercenaries led by Bonebreaker, Skullbuster, and Pretty Boy, the Reavers operated from out of a secret complex located underneath an abandoned town in the Australian outback. Utilizing the teleportation powers of the mutant aborigine named Gateway, whom they enslaved into their service by threatening to defile land sacred to his people, the Reavers first clashed with the team of mutant heroes the X-Men after robbing the Hoan International Bank in Hong Kong. The X-Men followed the Reavers back to Australia and easily defeated them, claiming the cyborgs’ base for themselves.

They placed Roxxon Oil president Jones, Hugh|Hugh Jones under the control of the mystical Serpent Crown hoping to raise the lost continent of Lemuria for Viper's ally, Krang, who was in turn acting under the Elder God Set's influence via the Serpent Crown.

This project also created solo operative Bushmaster, and may have empowered Asp, Cottonmouth, and Rattler as well. The new Squad acquired another Serpent Crown for Jones, escaping after his defeat.

description: The story of the Twelve begins with a young mutant by the name of Tanya Trask, who would later become Madam Sanctity. Adrift in the timestream, Tanya was rescued by Marvel Girl|Rachel Summers, in her guise of Mother Askani, and took her to the future, where she healed her mind. The future, under the rule of Apocalypse|Apocalypse, was somber and grim, and Tanya sought to change it. She traveled back in time, three years before the formation of the X-Men, despite Mother Askani's warnings not to do so, and attempted to contact her father, Trask, Bolivar|Bolivar Trask. Rachel followed her and stopped her from revealing herself to her father, but not before Tanya could tamper with her father's creation, Master Mold, and upload a program called "The Twelve".

Zemo barely tolerated Jolt, regarding her as little more than a public relations tool, but most of the team quickly grew fond of her and found her idealism infectious.

description: Former U.S. Representative and industrialist Vector|Simon Utrecht decided that economic and political power was insufficient, and sought super-powers. Scientist Ironclad|Michael Steel identified a window where the conditions which created the Fantastic Four could be duplicated, so Utrecht hired him to design, build and fly a spaceship. Accompanied by life support specialist Vapor|Ann Darnell and her brother, propulsion engineer X-Ray|James "Jimmy" Darnell, the foursome rocketed into the cosmic rays and were changed. Physicist Hulk|Bruce Banner found their New Mexico launch facility and aborted the flight; believing Banner had prevented them from gaining greater powers, the foursome attacked Banner, but their unfamiliarity with their powers let the Hulk defeat them. Fearing their lack of control could prove fatal, Utrecht funded research into technology to further this control. This technology proved capable of "curing" certain powers, which later intrigued Utrecht's friend and associat

description: The European dilettante and mercenary known as Silver Sable, head of Silver Sable International and ruler of the Balkan nation Symkaria, once led a group known as the Wild Pack. The Wild Pack was best known for the apprehension of international criminals and the recovery of stolen property for a wide spectrum of clients from major insurance companies to small nations. Sable typically led the team of agents into the field, although she had been known to parcel smaller-scale contracts to reduced versions of the Wild Pack such as the Delta Team. While typically comprised of elite mercenary soldiers, Sable would occasionally hire superhuman freelance operatives to serve on the Pack, such as Spider-Man|Spider-Man, the Sandman|Sandman, Rocket Racer and the Prowler|Prowler. Alternatively, Sable has twice formed elite versions of the Wild Pack, comprising them of superhuman agents-- first with the Outlaws and, later, the Intruders.

description: Combining sensationalism and ultraviolence, X-Force became a top-rated television show and its members instant stars. The near-suicidal nature of their missions was immediately apparent as the bodies of many members were laid to rest on the series' path to every watercooler in the nation. During a live broadcast where boy band Boyz R Us were held hostage, most of X-Force at the time met their doom. Following the massacre, the remaining members, Doop, U-Go Girl, and the Anarchist, met their new leader, Orphan|Guy Smith.

description: In the year 3016 on the technologically advanced alternate world known as Other Earth, 16-year-old robotics student Nathaniel Richards was rescued by his future self, the megalomaniacal time-traveler known as Kang The Conqueror, from a near-fatal attack. Kang outfitted young Nathaniel with a suit of psychokinetic armor that responded to his thoughts and gave him a glimpse of his future as a conqueror. Horrified at the death and destruction caused by his future self, young Nathaniel rejected the help of Kang and used his armor to escape to modern-day Earth-616, hoping to find the Avengers so that they could help him defeat Kang.
